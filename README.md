This Hangman game is a simple command-line version of the classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess the letters of a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed.
**How to Play**
- The game randomly selects a word from a list of words provided in words.txt.
- The player guesses letters one at a time.
- If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions.
- If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses a try and part of the hangman is drawn.
- The game continues until the player either guesses all the letters in the word or runs out of tries.
